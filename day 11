Prime Reversal
You are given two binary strings 
A
A and 
B
B, each of length 
N
N. You can perform the following operation on string 
A
A any number of times:

Select a prime number 
X
X.
Choose any substring of string 
A
A having length 
X
X and reverse the substring.
Determine whether you can make the string 
A
A equal to 
B
B using any (possibly zero) number of operations.

A substring is obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) elements from the beginning and some (possibly zero) elements from the end of the string.
